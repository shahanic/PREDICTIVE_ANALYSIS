Level,Recommendations
1,an active participation and consultation with different stakeholder may be undertaken to come up with significant input for the review and revision of the computer engineering curriculum
1,faculty member be encourage to submit their course syllabus regularly as require update and consistent for monitoring and compilation detail may include some other feature reflect the academic year below the course code andor descriptive title time frame in dayshours reference format bibliographical entry general and specific objective in behavioral form
1,there is a need to enhance the syllabus specially the bibliographic reading of all course major or minor should be of recent edition
1,faculty member of the computer engineering be encourage to produce more it base instructional material such as module manual and other computer aid instruction software these material be suggest to be review and recommend by the instructional material committee before they be utilized in instruction
1,memorandum of agreement moa with other learn institution and agency may be execute to maintain consortium and linkage with them for academic exchange of instructional material

1,innovative strategy may be utilized by faculty member in the delivery of their lecture and other activity as much as possible different technique should be employ in order to arouse student interest
1,the college of engineering may conduct a study on the employability of bachelor of science in computer engineering graduate and use it statistically treat result as well as feedback from employer in enhance the curriculum and it instructional content
1,conduct of research on academic performance of faculty and student be encourage

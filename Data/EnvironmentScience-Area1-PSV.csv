Level,Recommendations
PSV,"1. Make a follow-up study on the VMGO study to cover a wider number and categories of stakeholders, and after undergoing a thorough review and approval process by the authorities concerned, print and report as soon as possible and disseminate the copies to all concerned stakeholders."
PSV,"2. Constitute a committee to review and edit the present VMGOs to correct mistakes in grammar and if possible to keep them short and simple, brief enough to be interesting but adequate enough to cover the vital parts."
PSV,3. Incorporate a discussion of the VMGOs in the introductory part of each course syllabus to ensure that these are taken up as integral part of each course.
PSV,"4. Dissemination of the revised VMGOS should include the Ilocano translation thorough various forms of media to enable the clientele, including the non-English speaking Ilocanos, to better understand and hence better appreciate this well- crafted document."

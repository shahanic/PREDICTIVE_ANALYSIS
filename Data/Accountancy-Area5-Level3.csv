Level,Recommendations
3,"The Research Unit of CBEA may prepare a comprehensive and well-planned research program and the research agenda may be formulated on the basis of the thrusts of the University and other funding agencies. This may provide direction to the research thrusts of the program. Conversely, the importance of participation of the stakeholders and beneficiaries in the formulation of the research agenda may be encouraged and be properly documented."
3,"The College may spearhead extensive seminar-workshops on action research for both the faculty members and the students to enhance their capability, knowledge and skills in conducting research. Eventually, they may have a better appreciation of the importance of research which may motivate them to be engaged in all research­ related activities which may give them the opportunity of receiving awards, citations, or recognitions. ·"
3,"Collaborative research among the faculty members and students is essential. Hence, the faculty members and students may take the initiative of engaging in collaborative research pursuits which may be presented at the Research Directorate for possible funding. Also, interfacing research and extension may be observed and implemented."
3,"The creation of partnerships and networking/linkages, apart from the Research Directorate, with academic or higher education institutions with the end in view of providing and accessing instructional materials and journals may be prioritized. Likewise, consider outsourcing of national and international linkages via e­ communications. These can be done through a collaborative effort of the faculty members and alumni who have the connections in their respective workplaces/organizations. All linkages, however, should be documented and established with corresponding with Memorandum of Agreement."
3,There is a need for the publication of the CBEA Research Manual to be based on the University Research Manual focusing on the priorities and thrusts of the programs. It may be explicitly cited in the Manual the privileges and incentives that the faculty researchers may receive. A separate research budget for the College may be requested from the Research Directorate.
3,"A regular In-House Review of completed and on-going studies/projects in Accountancy may be conducted so that the students and faculty members can present their researches where awards may be given to best presenter and best paper. Financial incentives, however, may be given to the presenters."
3,"The College may publish a separate Research Journal for the faculty members and students at least once a year to showcase and disseminate their completed researches. However, only those papers presented in the In-House Review may be included in the journals."
3,All faculty members may conduct researches within their areas of specialization. The research undertakings may contribute significantly in the development of the institution and instructional enhancement and will be of great significance to the target clienteles.
3,"The faculty members are encouraged to respond to the ""Call for Papers"" for possible international presentation and publication in refereed journals. Incentives, however, may be provided to the faculty members who will take the initiative, without necessarily informing the Research Directorate, of submitting papers for presentation and publication."
3,The projects/research studies of the students as part of the course requirements may be placed in a resource room as exhibits to show the students' creative and innovative skills.
3,A research database may be constructed exclusively for the College for easy access of the research endeavors and accomplishments of both its faculty members and students.
3,The University may continuously apply for patent and license for its research projects.
3,"Supporting documents for every item may be systematically arranged, and neatly packaged. Lastly, the recommendations of the last accreditation visit may be strictly complied with."

Level,Recommendations
3," Involve faculty members in each department in the preliminary revisio computer engineering curriculum. Students, and industry should also be encouraged to participate in the review and revision of curriculum.   "
3,"Update course syllbi of all professional subjects to include learning strategies and criteria for grading in the syllabi. Likewise, suggested readings and reference materials should be of recent editions. Inclusion of websites is an advantage. Review the number of total required hours of lecture and lectures with lab subJects. One (1) hour for every one (1) unit lecture and equivalent three (3) hours for one (1) unit laboratory. "
3,Establish clear policy on the development of instructional materials. Also have these materials reviewed and approved by the Instructional Materials Committee.
3,"Encourage faculty members to produce custom-made instructional materials such as powerpoint presentation, interactive lectures, lb manuals, workbooks, books and others to their field of specialization."
3,Conduct a tracer study to monitor the employability of computer engineering graduates of the university.
3," Encourage graduating students to undergo examinations or certification such as civil service exam, TESDA certification, Microsoft, CISCO, etc. to broaden their job opportunities. Likewise, emphasis importance of Intellectual Property Rights."
3,"Come up with comprehensive in-house faculty development program such as trainings, seminars/conferences, graduate programs, etc. Faculty should apply membership in professional organizations to establish linkages."
3," It would be desirable if the teacher-made tests were based on Table of Specifications (TOS) to ensure that exams are comprehensive, valid and reliable measures of students' performance."
3,Widen  linkages  to  other  educational/training  institutions  for  the exchange/adoption of instructional materials.
3,Prioritize the purchase of licensed softwares used for instructional purposes in the college      
3,Students must be given a copy of the course syllabus at the start of each semester.
3,Accreditation is documentation. Compilation of documents pertaining to the involvement of faculty in any IT/engineering professional organization is a proof of participation.

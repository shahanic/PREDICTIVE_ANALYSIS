Level,Recommendations
1,An active participation and consultation with different stakeholders may be undertaken to come up with significant inputs for the review and revision of the Computer Engineering curriculum.
1,"Faculty members are encouraged to submit their course syllabi regularly as required, updated and consistent for monitoring and compilation. Details may include some other features reflecting the academic year below the course code and/or descriptive title, time frame, in days/hours, reference format (bibliographical entries), general and specific objectives (in behavioral forms);"
1,There is a need to enhance the syllabi specially the bibliographic readings of all courses (major or minor) should be of recent editions.
1,"Faculty members of the Computer Engineering are encouraged to produce more IT based instructional materials such as modules, manuals and other computer aided instruction software. These materials are suggested to be reviewed and recommended by the Instructional Material Committee before they are utilized in instruction."
1,Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with other learning institutions and agencies may be executed to maintain consortia and linkages with them for academic exchange of instructional materials.
1,"It is suggested that Table of Specifications be prepared for every departmental examination. Faculty members of the department may be trained in Test Preparation and Construction, as part of the Faculty Development Program."
1,"Innovative strategies may be utilized by faculty members in the delivery of their lectures and other activities. As much as possible, different techniques should be employed in order to arouse students' interests."
1,The College of Engineering may conduct a study on the employability of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering graduates and use its statistically treated results as well as feedbacks from employers in enhancing the curriculum and its instructional contents.
1,Conduct of researches on academic performance of faculty and students are encouraged.

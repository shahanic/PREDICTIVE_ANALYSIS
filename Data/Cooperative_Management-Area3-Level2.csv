2,"To improve the integrity of the theses/research papers and strengthen the defense process, the expert services of the external evaluators may be sought by the Dean, as per the recommendations of the Department Chair or Thesis Adviser. Their honoraria, however, may be increased or an additional fee may be given to compensate their efforts and cover their expenses including but not limited to gasoline and food. Also, theses/research papers should be subjected to plagiarism and grammar check."
2,"There is a need to periodically review the curriculum to meet the exigencies of time. Such undertaking, however, requires the involvement of the entire academic community including the alumni and representatives from the industry to ensure that the academe is in time with the demands of the industry. Likewise, proper documentation should be observed (i.e. letter of invitation, attendance sheet, minutes of the proceedings, pictures among others should be included among the documents)."
2,The faculty members may be encouraged to prepare/develop books/ instructional materials for their respective subjects and the same should be evaluated/reviewed by highly competent experts observing the rigid standard protocol including copyrighting.

Also, they can consider exposing the students more often to various academic pursuits like lakbay-aral or exposure trips, national conferences or fora on cooperative and different topics related to the course and other related-undertaking. Hence, the teaching-learning process can be more enjoyable and interesting on the part of the faculty members and students."

Likewise, consider networking with national and international linkages taking advantage of the internet or eÂ­ communications. These can be done through a collaborative effort of the faculty members and alumni who have the connections in their respective workplaces/organizations. All linkages, however, should be documented and supported with Memorandum of Agreement."
2,"Students' membership in recognized organizations, national and international, must be given attention."
2,"Encourage the faculty members and graduate students to be engage in collaborative researches that can be funded by the University or any funding agencies. These, however, should be based on the University or College priorities which can be beneficial to the entire academic community."
2,Conduct an in-depth study on the productivity of faculty members. academic performance of graduate students and level of success of graduates. This may serve as a mechanism in gathering feedbacks from stakeholders to improve the operation and management of the College.

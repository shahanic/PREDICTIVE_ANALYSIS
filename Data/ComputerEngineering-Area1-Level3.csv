3,"Conduct a study on the MGO involving different industries within the region, community and other linkages and students in the University to determine awareness and its acceptability. After undergoing a thorough review and approval process by the authorities concerned, disseminate it to all concerned stakeholders."
3,"Constitute a committee to review and edit the present VMGOs to correct mistakes in grammar and, if possible, to keep them short and simple, brief enough to be interesting but adequate enough to cover the vital parts."
3,The correct version along with the llocano translation may now be printed in sufficient copies for dissemination.

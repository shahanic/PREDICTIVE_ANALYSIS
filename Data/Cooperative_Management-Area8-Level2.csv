2,"The campus/college may develop a Solid Waste Management Program. The said Program will become the basis in coming up with a well-defined, comprehensive and sustainable way of handling solid wastes."

It has been noticed that while garbage bins have already been labelled, they do not function well for their intended purpose as bio-degradables and nonÂ­ biodegradables are still disposed under the same bins by the students.

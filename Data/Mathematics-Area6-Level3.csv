Level,Recommendations
3,1. The Department of Mathematics should follow closely the guidelines and regulations set forth in the University Manual of Operations in Extension. A reorientation about the use of the manual may be conducted.
3,2. The designed extension program and projects should be based on the needs and problems of the adopted communities. A research of the needs and problems of the adopted communities should be undertaken. Results of the research should be used as baseline information for designing the program and projects.
3,3. Regular monitoring and evaluation of extension projects should be undertaken. An effective and efficient monitoring and evaluation system may be designed. Appropriate instruments for monitoring and evaluation may also be developed.
3,4. More faculty members of the Department of Mathematics should actively participate in its extension and community involvement projects and other related activities.
3,"5. Adopted communities should be encouraged to participate actively in the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of extension projects."
3,6. The Department of Mathematics should exert efforts to generate additional funds for its extension program.
3,7. Wider dissemination of its extension program should be made.
3,8. A systematic and continuous documentation of the extension program and other related activities should be pursued vigorously.

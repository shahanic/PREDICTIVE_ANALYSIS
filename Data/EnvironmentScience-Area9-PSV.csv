PSV,1. The College should purchase additional prescribe demonstration table so as not to delay the simultaneous conduct of laboratory exercises in different laboratory rooms.
PSV,2. Doors of laboratory rooms should be made to open outward to conform with acceptable standards.
PSV,3. Safety and precautionary measures in the laboratories should be made more visible to students for them to easily internalize the importance of safety measures to avoid accidents inside the laboratory rooms.
PSV,4. Fire extinguishers should be properly installed ion the walls outside the laboratory rooms and offices to make them more accessible to students and employees in times of fire disaster.
PSV,"5. It is highly recommended that the faculty who teach physics laboratory should have Laboratory Manuals to strengthen the quality of knowledge gain by the students in conducting experiments. Likewise, the faculty teaching physics are encouraged to make their own Laboratory Manuals and have them approved. This would benefit them also in the NBC 461 evaluation."
PSV,6. A periodic fire drill activity should be encouraged in every college to enhance the knowledge of students on how to use properly the fire extinguisher in times of fire disaster.
PSV,7. Gas and water must be adequate when conducting laboratory exercises. An additional water tank should be installed in the college to so as not to hamper the students from conducting their laboratory exercises.
PSV,8. Additional demonstration table for the chemistry laboratory rooms should be purchased that conform to acceptable standards to allow simultaneous functional use of the different laboratory rooms.
PSV,9. A separate equipment and supply room may be installed in every laboratory rooms to make them more accessible to students who use that particular laboratory room.
PSV,10. An additional store room should be constructed on the microbiology laboratory room so that supplies and other materials are not scattered within the room and to make it more spacious to work in.

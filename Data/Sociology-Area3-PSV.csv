Level,Recommendations
PSV,"1. The VMGOs should not only be listed in the syllabi for more compliance but they should be discussed as part of the introductory portion of each course. While some syllabi include the VMGOs for discussion at the beginning of a course, and likewise taken up in various fora such as in the general orientation of students at the beginning of each semester, taking them up for discussion at the beginning of each course should be an important means for further reinforcement of awareness and acceptance of such VMGOs among students."
PSV,"2. More teaching materials by more faculty members should be encouraged and if possible, adequate incentives be given for those who have written such teaching materials."
PSV,3. A hands-on training program on the development of instructional materials should be held for faculty members which should include writing modules and instructional materials as well as actual use of computers for computer-based instruction.
PSV,4. There should be a seminar-workshop on curriculum development where the related concepts and theories are discussed and where exercises on objective formulation are conducted. Mager's books and some other references on writing behavioral objectives may be used. Experts on curriculum development should be invited as resource persons in such seminar-workshop.
PSV,5. Team efforts in writing and/or revising course syllabi should be encouraged as better course syllabi have been produced through such team and participatory effort.
PSV,"6. Use references which have been published at least five years reckoned from the date the particular syllabus was written. However, it is recommended that classics in the discipline of the particular course be used."

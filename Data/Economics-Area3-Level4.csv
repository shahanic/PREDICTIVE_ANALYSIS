4,"Regularly updating the syllabi, with inclusion of more references that are of more recent editions is suggested."

4,"Aside from thesis writing, On-the-Job Training, Practicum, other work related activities may be included in the curriculum for enhanced learning outcomes."
4,Participation of industry practitioners and other stake olders in curriculum revision and enrichment to ensure a close match between the students' training and the demands of the jobs they will soon occupy may be considered.

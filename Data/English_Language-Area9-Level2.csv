Sci. 12 may include in the methodology and class activity of the course the visit to the science laboratory rooms to familiarize students with the basic laboratory set-up."
2,"3. Refurbishing many of the facilities in the science laboratory, including the water and gas supply, may have to be a continuing target for CAS."
2,"4. There is a need to emphasize all the time that the responsibility of maintaining the laboratories neat and orderly should be shared by the students, faculty and the utility personnel."
2,"5. If funds are available, purchasing and assigning one permanent projector in big lecture rooms will help minimize the wear and tear of equipment when setting up limited number of projectors in different classrooms each time faculty members make use of this equipment. The availability of more projection equipment would also encourage faculty members to develop more teacher-made multi-media instructional presentations."

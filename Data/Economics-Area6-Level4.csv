Level,Recommendations
4,"The Extension Unit of CBEA may prepare a comprehensive and well-planned extension program and the extension agenda will be formulated on the basis of the thrusts of the University and other funding/partner agencies. This will provide direction to the extension thrusts of the program. Conversely, the importance of participation of the stakeholders/partners in the formulation of the extension agenda may be designed and realized and should be properly documented."
4,"Although the faculty members involved in extension services have attended trainings spearhead by various partner agencies, proper documentation may be done and given importance. Likewise, the faculty-trainers may prepare modules and results of evaluation of their use and of the training conducted may be analyzed and utilized as benchmark data for other possible extension pursuits."
4,"The extension programs exclusive for the College, specifically for the program under survey, may be given priority. It is essential, however, that the extension programs or services be formalized with a Memorandum of Agreement stating among others the responsibilities of the parties and extent of services to be provided. Proper monitoring and evaluation of the programs or activities be strictly observed."
4,"Interfacing research and extension is encouraged. Hence, the research outputs of the students as requirements of their subjects may be used as baseline data for a possible extension program or activities for the target clienteles. The research may also be a collaborative effort of students and faculty members. Nevertheless, research outputs can only be considered as extension program if accepted and implemented by the clienteles or partner agencies."
4,"Prioritize the creation of partnerships and networking/linkages, with other academic or higher education institutions and potential partner agencies with the end in view of providing and exchanging/accessing manuals and journals and good extension practices. Likewise, consider outsourcing of national and international linkages via e­ communications. These can be done through a collaborative effort of the faculty members and alumni who have the connections in their respective workplaces/organizations. All linkages, however, should be documented and established with corresponding Memorandum of Agreement"
4,There is a need for the publication of the CBEA Extension Manual based on the University Extension Manual focusing on the priorities and thrusts of the programs. It may be explicitly cited in the Manual the privileges and incentives that the faculty members may receive. A separate extension budget for the College may be requested from the Extension Directorate.
4,The College may publish a Newsletter at least once a year to disseminate the extension efforts and activities of both faculty members and students.
4,An extension database may be constructed exclusively for the College for easy access of the extension initiatives and accomplishments of both the faculty members and the students.
4,An impact study of the extension programs of the College may be conducted to determine the contribution of the programs to the enhancement of the socio­ economic status of the clients.
4,"Supporting documents for every it may be, systematically arranged, and neatly packaged. Lastly, the recommendations of the last accreditation visit may be strictly complied with."
